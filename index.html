        <p>A penguin from the popular children series Madagascar is now volunteering as a sheriff and decided to take control over a testing website, build by the developer named vrlc96. The sheriff is wearing a cowboy hat, a sheriff star on his left breast and is holding a loaded gun on his left head, pointing to somewhere. The penguin has claimed that he will protect this website against suspicious behavior. Then he asked the journalists, if we have ever heard about the video game "Among Us"? The website creator is happy about the support he is getting without requesting for any help.</p>
